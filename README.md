# EmployeeAttrition
Developed a Machine Learning model with high predictive accuracy(90%) to forecast employee turnover,  enabling proactive decision-making and HR intervention strategies.

## Mechanism

Data Acquisition: 
 
● We , likely won't have access to real IBM employee data due to 
privacy concerns. However, we can leverage publicly available 
datasets like the IBM HR Attrition dataset on Kaggle 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics- 
attrition-dataset. 
 
Data Splitting and Preparation: 
● The training set will be used to build the model, and the testing set 
will be used to evaluate its accuracy in predicting employee 
attrition. 
● Explore and understand the features in the dataset. These might 
include factors like: 
● Employee demographics (age, gender, department) 
● Job details (job satisfaction, work-life balance, years with 
company) 
● Performance metrics (salary, promotions, trainings received) 
 
Data Preprocessing: 
●  Handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies 
through appropriate preprocessing techniques to ensure the 
dataset's quality. 
 
Machine Learning Model Building: 
 
● Apply various machine learning algorithms typically used for 
classification tasks, such as: 
● Logistic Regression: A classic algorithm for predicting binary 
outcomes (employee leaving or staying) 
● Decision Trees: Easy to interpret and understand, providing 
insights into key factors influencing attrition. 
 
 
Evaluation and Feature Engineering: 
 
● Train each model on the training set and evaluate its performance 
on the testing set using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. 
 
Learning Outcomes: 
 
● Gain experience with Python libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn 
for data manipulation and machine learning model development. 
● Understand the process of building and evaluating machine 
learning models for real-world business problems like employee 
retention. 
Solution Approach: 
 
● Logistic Regression: 
Predicts the probability of an employee leaving based on their 
features, allowing for classification into high or low-risk categories. 
Analysing the model's coefficients will reveal which factors have 
the strongest positive or negative influence on employee retention. 
 
● K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 
Classifies employees based on the similarity of their features to 
those who previously left IBM. Here, choosing the optimal K value 
and potentially scaling features are crucial. 
 
● Decision Tree: 
Creates a tree-like structure that recursively splits the data based 
on the most important factors influencing employee departure. This 
method offers valuable insights into the key drivers of attrition. 
 
● Gradient Boosting Classifier: 
Builds an ensemble of decision trees, where each tree focuses on 
correcting the errors of the previous one. This ensemble approach 
can lead to a robust and accurate model. 
 
 
● Random Forest: 
 
Similar to gradient boosting, it builds an ensemble of decision trees 
but introduces randomness in feature selection at each split. This 
helps prevent overfitting and improve generalizability across 
different departments or demographics 
 
 
● Support Vector Machine (SVM): 
 
Working: SVMs aim to find a hyperplane in the feature space that 
best separates the data points representing employees who left 
(positive class) from those who stayed (negative class). This 
hyperplane maximizes the margin between the classes, leading to 
a robust decision boundary. 
Considerations: Choosing the right kernel function (e.g., linear, 
radial basis) is crucial for SVM performance in employee attrition 
prediction. Feature scaling might also be necessary. 
 
● Neural Network: 
 
Working: Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and 
consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons. These 
neurons learn complex patterns from the data to predict employee 
attrition. 
Considerations: Neural networks can be powerful but require 
careful tuning of hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, neurons 
per layer) to avoid overfitting and achieve optimal performance. 
 
● XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting): 
 
Working: XGBoost is an ensemble learning technique that builds a 
series of decision trees sequentially. Each tree focuses on 
correcting the errors of the previous one, resulting in a highly 
accurate model for predicting employee attrition.Benefits: XGBoost 
offers built-in regularization to prevent overfitting and handles 
missing values effectively. It can also be interpretable to some 
extent, providing insights into the factors influencing employee 
departure.
